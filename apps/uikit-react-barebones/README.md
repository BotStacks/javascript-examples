# React UIKit barebones example

This example uses the `@botstacks/chat-react` package. In it you can see a simple demo using pre-defined users.
To start, run

```
yarn nx serve uikit-react-barebones
```

from the root directory. Don't forget to set your api key environment variable `VITE_API_KEY`.

You will find the chat interface at http://localhost:4200. Go to this url on another browser and try logging in as a different user to experience the chat sdk functionality in real-time.
